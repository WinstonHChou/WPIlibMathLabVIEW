Use the github issues menu <a href="https://github.com/jsimpso81/WPIlibMathLabVIEW/issues"> https://github.com/jsimpso81/WPIlibMathLabVIEW/issues</a> to submit information on issues and suggested enhancements.
<p>
When submitting an issue, please follow these guidelines:

    <p><li>Make certain you are using the latest version of the library. If not, install the latest version and see if the issue still occurs.
    <p><li>See if the issue has already been reported. If so, add any new details to the existing issue.
    <p><li>Write a very detailed specific description of the problem.
    <p><li>Include any screen shots or other data needed to show the issue.
    <p><li>Describe exactly how to reproduce the error. (Likely, I can't try this on your robot...)
    <p><li>If possible, try and condense the problem to a small test program that isolates the issue.
    <p><li>If you found a work around, please include it for others to use. See the Contributing section of the github repository for additional details.
<p>
I'll attempt to deal with issues in a reasonable time, but there are no guarantees.
