The WPILib LabVIEW Math contains LabVIEW functions, data clusters, and utility programs 
for use in the First Robototics Competition.  It implements the routines found mostly in 
the "math" section WPILIB library for Java and C++ that don't already exist in LabVIEW. 
<p>
The utility programs, found under WPILib LabVIEW in the Windows start menu, include trajectory editors, trajectory file conversions, and robot code simulators.

<p>
The library has an extensive set of examples that can be found under the LabVIEW "Find examples..." menu.

<p>
A separate github repository stores additional function examples and sample robot code.  It
can be found here.  <a href="https://github.com/jsimpso81/WPIlibMathLabVIEW_Examples">https://github.com/jsimpso81/WPIlibMathLabVIEW_Examples</a> 

<p>
The library source code, package build specifications, help builder tools, and test package can be found
here <a href="https://github.com/jsimpso81/WPIlibMathLabVIEW">https://github.com/jsimpso81/WPIlibMathLabVIEW</a>
