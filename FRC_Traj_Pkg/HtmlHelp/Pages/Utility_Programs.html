The WPILIB LabVIEW Math library contains a number of utility programs.  These can be accessed from 
the Windows Start menu under the "WPILib LabVIEW" group.  These programs include:
<p>
<p><li>Create/Edit Trajectory
<p><li>Create/Edit PathFinder Differential Drive Trajectory
<p><li>Create/Edit PathFinder Swerve Drive Trajectory
<p><li>Convert Trajectory JSON file to CSV
<p><li>Convert Trajectory CSV file to JSON
<p><li>Simulate a Romi robot
<p><li>Simulate a Differential Drive robot

<h3>Create/Edit Trajectory</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">

Create or edit a trajectory using the WPILIB LabVIEW Math routines and write it to a CSV 
(comma separated value) or JSON file that can be copied to a RoboRIO and read by 
the robot code. The trajectory is created by:

    <p><li>Defining robot properties
    <p><li>Defining drive system constraints
    <p><li>Defining the trajectory "waypoints".
    <p><li>Creating and reviewing the trajectory. If changes need to be made, repeat the previous steps as needed.
    <p><li>Write the trajectory to a file. (CSV or JSON)
    <p><li>Optionally write trajectory definition configuration. This allows future modification without redefining entire trajectory information.

<h3>Create/Edit PathFinder Differential Drive Trajectory</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
Create a trajectory using Jaci Brunning's Pathfinder library for a robot using a "differential 
drive" and write it to a CSV (comma separated value) file that can be used by the WPILib LabVIEW Math 
library.
<p>
More information on Pathfinder can be found here <a href="https://github.com/JaciBrunning/Pathfinder">
https://github.com/JaciBrunning/Pathfinder</a>
<p>
One of the biggest differences between this Trajectory Library and Pathfinder is that Pathfinder 
contains acceleration limiting (jerk) that does not exist in the other available libraries.

<h3>Create/Edit PathFinder Swerve Drive Trajectory</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
Create a trajectory using Jaci Brunning's Pathfinder library for a robot using a "swerve  
drive" and write it to a CSV (comma separated value) file that can be used by the WPILib LabVIEW 
Math library.

<h3>Convert Traject JSON file to CSV</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
This utility reads a JSON file created by the Trajectory Creation utility, PathWeaver, PathPlanner, or
other WPILib compatible tool and converts it to a CSV file that can be used by the WPILib LabVIEW Math 
library (The WPILib LabVIEW math library can also use the JSON file directly.)

<br><br>
<h3>Convert Traject CSV file to JSON</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
This utility reads a CSV file created by the Trajectory Creation utility and converts it to a JSON file 
that can be used by the WPILib C++/Java library.  (The WPILib LabVIEW math trajectory creation tool
can also write JSON files directly.)

<br><br>
<h3>Romi Robot Simulator</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
Simulate a Differential Drive robot.  


<br><br>
<h3>Differential Drive Simulator</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
Simulate a Differential Drive robot.  This allows for testing of drive code and execution of trajectories.
