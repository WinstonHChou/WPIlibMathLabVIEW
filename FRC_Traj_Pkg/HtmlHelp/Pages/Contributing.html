Contributions of enhancements, bug fixes, and new routines are welcome. If new routines 
are not already part of the C++/Java WPILIB, then it seems fair that they should be written 
solely by FRC student members, with confirmation from a mentor on their team to be able to be 
candidates for inclusion.

See the Contributing section on the github repository for additional details.
