<h2>Description and Conventions</h2>

<br><br>
<h3>Function Naming</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
The VI in this library are grouped into categories mostly according to functionality.  The VI file 
name starts with the group name followed by a suffix describing the function of the particular VI.
<p>
Since this library was patterned after the C++/Java version of the WPILIB, many of the group names are 
similar to their C++/Java counterpart.  As such, those familiar with the C++/Java library should be
able to use this library fairly easily.  Also, while these functions are fully documented, the C++ or 
Java documentation will mostly describe this library as well.  
<p>
The HTML and PDF reference documentation for the library is organized by these function groups. 
<br><br>
<h3>"Execute" Functions</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
In order simplify engineering control systems with LabVIEW and this library, additional functions
providing the all the functionality of a function group in a single VI have been provided for most
function groups.  The names of these VI end with the "_EXECUTE" suffix.  For many function groups
they may be the only function that is needed. 
<p>
In some cases where the number of inputs to a function is large, helper functions have also been
provided that feed the "_EXECUTE" function all the needed data.
<p>
The following picture shows the "_EXECUTE" function for the Advanced PID Function".

<h3>Function Menu</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
Menu items for all the subVI's are included as part of the standard LabVIEW WPI Robotics Library menu
<p>

<p>
The functions anticipated to be the most used have been gathered into general sub-menus located at
the top of the main menu.

Below are the Analog, Digital (boolean), and Trajectory general menus

<br><br>
<h3>Function Snippets</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
To make the functions easier to use, a number of the menu items place "snippets" of code that includes the desired function and other functions or constants often wired to the function.  Menu item icons for snippets use a unique background color.  Unless the name is too long, the menu item name ends with "snippet". 
<p>
The "general" function sub-menus are all snippets.
<p>
The following shows an example of a “snippet”.<img src="images/MacroSample.png" alt="menu">

<h3>Function Help</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
Each VI includes help that can be accessed using the standard LabVIEW help toggle (Ctrl H).
<p>

<br><br>
<h3>Function Examples</h3>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH=" 100.000000%" COLOR="GREY">
Many of the functions have examples that can be found under the LabVIEW "Find examples..." function.  
(Help -> Find Examples...).  The function examples are easiest to find when "Directory Structure" is
selected.
