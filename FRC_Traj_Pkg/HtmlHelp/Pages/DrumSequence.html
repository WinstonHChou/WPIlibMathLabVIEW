When the Drum Sequencer is "Ready" and the "Initiate" input becomes TRUE,, the drum sequences through its set of steps from 1 to N.  After each Step is executed it is followed by a wait.  During the wait the Step output indicates "Do Nothing".   The number of Steps is determined by the number of elements in the "Step Times" input array.  Once all the steps have been executed, the Drum Sequencer cycles bac to wait for another initiate.  <BR>
<BR>
There is a Cancel input that interrupts the sequence, executes the Cancel Step, performs the cancel wait, and then returns to wait for an Initiate action.  <BR>
<BR>
If any of the Step Times, or Cancel times are negative, or there more than 32 steps, or less than 1 step an error is signaled.  The drum sequencer selects the error state and stays there.<BR>
